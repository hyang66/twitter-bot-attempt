You should've seen my cursive back then
Every letter was above the line
My ps and qs raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now
You never lifted your voice
You never raised your hand
You never showed me your inhuman
You understand
Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves
Most people are jokes but you're so real
Most of the time that I use the word "you"
Well you know that I'm mostly singing about you
You swore you'd never use the face that your ex invented
So let's meet up in uncanny valley
You never lifted your voice
You never raised your hand
I only show you my inhuman
You understand
You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
I'm a good person, I'm a powerful person
I don't believe in evil
I think that evil is an idea created by others to avoid dealing with their own nature
I understand my own nature
Good and evil have nothing to do with it
I understand myself, I control myself
I control everything within myself
My domain is my domain
I can lie on my back and affect the lives of those I love without moving a finger
But I would only affect them in good ways
I don't waste time on evil
I'm a good person
Is this thing on?
Do you know about Jesus?
Do you really know?
All you know is what you've been told
Listen with your heart, sing with your heart
You've just been singing about girls
What do you know about girls? Fuck
Why are you so tense?
You've gotta start singing with love in your heart, is this on?
Adam, are you here?
A pain star has entered your house, but what are you going to do about it?
Are you going to touch it? It only once happens every thousand years, maybe even two thousand years
And how long is a year, really?
It's almost Halloween
I haven't done shit this year
It's been a summer, it's been summer since February, I was in Australia
God, California? Then what? June, July, August, a month in Europe
I can't even go to Ikea anymore, I've got flashbacks, fuck
You should see the lights that I got there, I think you'd like them
I think you'd like them a lot

That's not what I meant to say at all
I mean I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you
But that's not what I wanted to say at all
I mean I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you
"Is it the Chorus yet?"
"No, it's just the building of the verse
So when the chorus does come, it'll be more rewarding."
I would speak to you in song
But you can't sing as far as I'm aware
Though everyone can sing as you are well aware
I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive
Everybody's swinging their hips
Everybody's giving the waitress tips
Everybody's dancing all of the dances
Everybody's dancing every dance now
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There's no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They're just two normal people
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
Well, so what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)
Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified, your body could fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place
And I know that I don't talk a lot
But I know that you don't care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We'll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance, when we
When we dance, when we
Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified your body will fall apart at any second

last night I drove to Harper's ferry and I thought about you
There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again
What should I do? (Eat breakfast)
What should I do? (Eat lunch)
What should I do? (Eat dinner)
What should I do? (Go to bed)
Where can I go? (Go to the store)
Where can I go? (Apply for jobs)
Where can I go? (Go to a friend's)
Where can I go? (Go to bed)
I wrote "Beach Death" when I thought you were taken
I wrote "Beach Funeral" when I knew you were taken
I wrote "Beach Fagz" well it wasn't about you
But it could've been, well no it couldn't have
(I spent a week in Ocean City) I spent a week in ocean city
(And came back to find you were gone) and came back to find you were gone
(I spent a week in Illinois) I spent a week in Illinois
(And came back to find you were still gone) and came back to find you were still gone
I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends
I never came out to my friends
We were all on Skype
And I laughed and I changed the subject
She said, "What's with this dog motif?"
I said, "Do you have something against dogs?"
I am almost completely soulless
I am incapable of being human
I am incapable of being inhuman
I am living uncontrollably
It should be called the anti-depression
As a friend of mine suggested
Because it's not the sadness that hurts you
It's the brain's reaction against it
It's not enough to love the unreal
I am inseparable from the impossible
I want gravity to stop for me
My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature
I want a cut scene, I want a cut from your face to my face
I want a cut, I want the next related video
I don't want to go insane
I don't want to have schizophrenia
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
It's been a year since we first met
I don't know if we're boyfriends yet
Do you have any crimes
That we can use to pass the time
I'm running out of drugs to try
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with a flashlight
It was the start of nothing (backwards)
And it was my favorite scene
I couldn't tell you what it means
But it meant something to me
And pretty soon you'll find some nice young
Satanist with braces and one
Capital "O", significant Other
And you can take him home to your mother and
Say, "Ma, this is my brother"
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
By the one you love
When they put their lips around you
You can feel their smile from the inside
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
Your ears perked up
I perked up when your ears perked up
You were all looking around
And I hoped it was for me
I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me
The ancients saw it coming
You can see that they tried to warn them
In the tales that they told their children
But they fell out of their heads in the morning
They said sex can be frightening
But the children were not listening
And the children cut out everything
Except for the kissing and the singing
When they finally found their home
At Walt Disney studios
And then everyone grew up
With their fundamental schemes fucked right up
But there are lots of fish left in the sea
There are lots of fish in business suits
That talk and walk on human feet
And visit doctors, have weak knees
Oh please let me join your cult
I'll paint my face in your colors
You have a real nice face
I had an early death
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed over your grave (we're too scared to do shit)
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed over your grave (we're too scared to do shit)

I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme light your cigarette
Come visit Kansas for a week of debauchery
Songs and high fives and weird sex

Cute thing
Don't be rude, thing
Hot thing
It was nothing

God
Give me Dan Bejar's voice
And John Entwistle's stage presence
I will be your rock, God, when you're rolling the dice

I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme smoke your weed, no wait
Healthy minds make sexy bodies
Let us touch so much of ourselves together

Cute thing
Don't be rude, thing
Hot thing
It was nothing

Dog
Give me one little chance
I can make you a man
I will be your rock, dog, when you're rolling your eyes

He died in an explosion
Of mixed media and poorly written reviews
And some stammering drunk who tried to tell him how good his shit was
That is some good shit, man
I accidentally spoke your first name aloud
Trying to make it fit in the lyrics of "Ana Ng," worked like a charm
We're getting old
When will we walk in each other's majestic presence?
Listen, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if I was John Linnell
Or trying to be John Linnell

I have loved
I will sleep naked
Next to you naked
I have loved
I have loved
I will sleep naked
Next to you naked
I have loved
Like some Stanley Kubrick porn director
Casting couples
Eyes wide shut for a reason
