# twitter-bot-attempt
my first attempt at a twitter bot :)

The below are in reverse order of how I worked up to the final bot!

## markov_sengen.py:
This is a bot that will, given a corpus of text, generate new sentences based on the text provided, using a markov chain.
Based on the word link length, the sentences generated can be adjusted for how much they adhere to the original text!

## read_from_file.py
First attempt at a bot, which would just take in a file and tweet out lines from that file

## hello_world.py
First attempt at using the twitter API to tweet something
